Enjoy!  

The primary feature of this mod is a new Civic called "Domesticators"  
- This civic requires Xenophile ethics and is mutually exclusive with the Warrior Culture, Shared Burdens and Slaver Guild civics  
- The civic unlocks the "floret" job, creating 1 floret job slot for every 8 planet pops.  
The floret job requires the Residency species rights, so you may need to change your default species rights.  
- After researching the Haustoric Implant technology (which replaces Subdermal Implants), pops with the floret job will automatically receive the Haustoric Implant species trait.  This trait locks them into Residency, Chemical Bliss, Exempt, Population Controls Enabled, and colonization Forbidden species rights. The trait is added to florets at the end of each month.  
- Pops with the Haustoric Implant trait no longer receive the resource production malus from Chemical Bliss. The trait also gives a +20% Amenities bonus, a +5% Unity bonus and a -5% Empire Sprawl bonus.
- Additional floret job slots are provided by higher-level planet capital buildings, and by housing districts if the player has selected the Prosperity - Interstellar Franchising tradition.  
- The bonus florets from Interstellar Franchising replace the normal bonus clerk jobs from this tradition.  
- The Commercial Zones build now provides 1 clerk and 2 floret jobs for Domesticators (normally 3 clerks). The Commercial Megaplex building now provides 2 clerk, 3 floret, 1 entertainer, and 1 merchant job for Domesticators (normally 6 clerks, 1 merchant).  
- Domesticators get a +5% production bonus to consumer goods to balance out the increased consumer goods upkeep from the Chemical Bliss living standard. You'll still likely need to invest in your industries to keep your florets supplied with pretty clothes and xenodrugs.  

Countries subjugated by a Domesticator have some unique effects  
- These subjects will automatically have their goverment and ethics switched to match their overlord, as well as gain the Domesticators civic.  
- They will have their primary species and graphic style changed to match their overlord.
- They will also have their flag and empire name re-generated.  
- The will automatically receive a few new leaders of their new primary species, but all leaders not of that species will be fired.  
- All planets in the new subject with less than 2 pops of the new primary species will have 2 pops resettled in from one of the overlord's planets.  Additionally, 2 pops not of the primary species will be resettled in the opposite direction.  
- All military ships and armies owned by the subject will be disbanded. The subject and overlord will each receive a modest sum of minerals and alloys to represent the scrap value.  
- Citizenship rights and policies within the subject will be somewhat restricted, and most pops will be switched over to Residency citizenship.  

Other features:
- Icons for Haustoric Implant and Haustoric Module by Miss_Praxis.  Ser work is seriously amazing.
- Icons for Biorhythm Amplification by theyentanator, also of the amazing art skills.
- 2 Affini Compact flag symbols. - Art credit to GlitchyRobo  
- Beeple species portrait. - Bee portrait credit to Hirvia, Alexthe666 & ⑧ ҠƗ₱ɗєҠƗ₱.ᵉˣᵉ [⇄]  

In addition, I have included my takes on the Affini Compact and Terran Accord civilizations.  Neither of these in-game representations should be considered canon.  
- To use these civs, copy the contents of \custom_civs\user_empire_designs.txt into your user_empire_designs.txt file.  
- This file is typically located at C:\Users\\{username}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\user_empire_designs.txt  


I welcome any and all feedback and criticism from users as I strive to balance canon with game balance and the inherent limitations of Stellaris.
