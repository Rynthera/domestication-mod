These slug-shaped creatures consist mostly of a complex brain in a resistant protein casing. Despite their neurological advancement, their lack of external organs and limited motor capacities make any attempts at communication exceedingly difficult. After weeks of frustration, [Root.GetLeaderName] experimented with introducing the creatures into an animal host. The reptilians these neural symbionts once built a primitive society with on [From.From.GetName] are too aggressive to facilitate experimentation, so a number of substitute species from the surface were tested instead.\n\nRegrettably, the symbionts refused to attach themselves to any of the offered animals.

They claim their past union with the reptiles on [From.From.From.GetName] came to end when their hosts grew unfoundedly suspicious of them. In fits of rage, the reptiles began tearing off their symbionts and clubbing them to death. Dismayed by their hosts' actions, the symbionts that survived retreated away from the reptiles, who without the neural stimulation of their slugs devolved back into non-sapient beasts.\n\nThe symbionts would like to extend an offer of union to other sophonts in the [Root.Owner.GetName].
