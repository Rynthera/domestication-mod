[h1]A Stellaris mod based on the Human Domestication Guide universe created by GlitchyRobo[/h1]

[b] Ever wanted to domesticate the universe, but dont like machines? [/b]
    The main focus of this mod is the addition of the Domesticators Origin

[b] Play as the Affini Compact or the Terran Accord! [/b]
    The mod includes a pre-built civilization for the Affini Compact using the Domesticators Origin.
    It also includes a pre-built Terran Accord civilization so that you can play out the Terran Pacificiation Campaign from either side.
    * Pre-built Affini Compact civilization uses the Phototrophic and Budding traits, which require the Plantoids DLC, and the Byzantine Bureaucracy civic, which requires Megacorp DLC. Feel free to create your own Affini civilization if you do not have these DLC.

[b] Keep florets! [/b]
    This job replaces a portion of clerk jobs in buildings and civics that give them, with an additional job for every 8 planetary population and from the planet's capital building.
    Florets produce extra unity, amenties and reduce crime!
    With the new Haustoric Implant technology, replacing Subdermal Implants, your florets will gain the Haustoric Implant trait!
    This locks them into the chemical bliss, without the production malus, reducing their impact on empire sprawl and increasing the amenities and unity they produce.
    To keep up with the endless demands of new sophonts, your empire also has slightly decreased consumer goods usage!

[b] Pet the universe! [/b]
    With this civic, you also unlock a new specialist subject type: Domesticated Protectorate!
    Your Protectorate will receive bonuses to building contruction in exchange for fleet capacity. You'll also exchange population, adopt florets, and eventually replace the Protectorate's primary species with your own!
    * Domesticated Protectorates require Overlord DLC

[b] Put wayward florets in good homes! [/b]
    The civic also unlocks the Benefic Acquisition ascension perk.
    Rescue sophonts from their oppressors with the Raiding bombardment stance, or lure them to your empire with the Biorhythm Transmitter starbase module.

[b] Show off your florets! [/b]
    Leaders can acquire their own florets over the course of the game!
    Florets provide unique effects for their owners.  Try to rescue as many as you can!

[b] Role-play as the Affini! [/b]
    Many events that you'll encounter during the game have alternate paths available to empires with the Domesticators origin.
    "Hire" florets from caravans, domesticate the Nemma turtles, use strange exo-plants as xenodrugs, and more!

[b] Re-bloom your leaders! [/b]
    Leaders will rebloom when they die, resetting their age and traits, while only suffering a small skill decrease.
    Best of all, they keep their florets in their next bloom!

[b] Defeat Capitalism! [/b]
    A new civic, Cosmic Harmony, allows you to use the Shared Burden living standard, gives a bonus to Xenophile ethics attraction, and gives a permanent opinion bonus with other empires!

[b] Beautiful new graphics! [/b]
