It looks like each ship type (artifical vs bioship once again) has a list of allowed graphical cultures, bioships can use biogenesis_01 and biogenesis_02
So, the bug causes the ships not to be able to be made anymore when swapped to a different graphical culture as they wouldn't have a model.

solution is likely something to either do a check to make sure the graphical culture list matches the other 
or give the subject country the ship technology for the new graphical culture.

Current hopefully temporary fix is simply commenting out the graphical culture change in event domestication.23
